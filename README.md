# DarkSoulsMVC
A Dark Souls themed MVC I made for class
## What does it do?
This MVC functions much like a guide for players. You can enter information about the various Bosses, Enemies, Items, and Locations within the game. Everything belongs to a Location
and by looking at the details of a Location you can see all other items tied to that Location.
